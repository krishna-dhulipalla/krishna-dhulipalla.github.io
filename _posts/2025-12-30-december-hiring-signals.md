excerpt: December isn’t “dead.” It’s noisy, uneven, and full of timing signals. Here’s what I observed by tracking company hiring momentum daily—and how to prepare for January after the holidays.

Most people treat December as a write-off for job search.

I used to think the same—until I started tracking hiring changes daily across my company list.

What I learned is simple:

**December isn’t dead. It’s just uneven.**
And because it’s uneven, it creates _signals_ that are easy to miss if you only look at job boards.

This post is a December recap (based on daily hiring momentum tracking), plus how I’m preparing for January.

## The 3 biggest December patterns I noticed

### 1) Hiring wasn’t steady — it was “bursty”

Instead of smooth growth, I saw days with:

- high additions,
- sudden removals,
- and short windows where things moved fast.

This is exactly why weekly “momentum” is more useful than just counting open roles.

### 2) “Churn” mattered more than raw volume

A big company can add a lot and remove a lot in the same window.

That creates a different reality than “hiring is up”:

- teams are backfilling,
- roles are being reposted,
- postings can disappear quickly.

So I started watching **Added + Removed together**, not just “Added.”

---

### 3) Many roles were short-lived

This is the most practical December lesson:

If roles close fast, your strategy must change.

For at least some companies in my tracking, the durability signal looked like:

- median open time measured in days (not weeks),
- a large fraction of roles closing within a week.

That implies:

- if you’re applying, you can’t “wait until weekend”
- if you’re networking, earlier is better (you want to be in the loop before the posting)

## Weekday effect: when jobs tend to appear (and disappear)

Once you track daily diffs, an uncomfortable truth shows up:

**Hiring activity is not evenly distributed across the week.**

So I started looking at:

- which weekdays had the highest additions,
- which had the highest removals,
- and how that changed during the holiday stretch.

Even a simple weekday heatmap makes timing visible.

## Booming vs freezing: why December can be misleading

December is full of “false calm.”

A company can look stable because:

- it isn’t posting much,
- but it also isn’t removing much.

Another company can look active but be:

- removing a lot (freeze risk),
- or churning (reposts/backfill).

So I tracked a simple distribution:

- how many companies were booming vs freezing vs stable each day/week.

## What I expect in January (and how I’m preparing)

This part is not a guarantee—just a plan based on how hiring usually behaves after holidays plus what December signals suggest.

### Likely January dynamics

- **Reactivations:** paused roles reappear
- **New focus areas:** fresh headcount priorities show up
- **More consistent cadence:** fewer holiday-driven gaps
- **Faster closing windows:** early January can move quickly

### My January prep checklist

1. Identify companies with **late-December momentum** (they may carry into January)
2. Prioritize companies where roles close fast → be ready to act within 48 hours
3. For slow-durability companies → prepare targeted networking and referrals
4. Use news only when it aligns with spikes/freezes (context, not distraction)

## Why this matters

If you’re applying randomly, December feels quiet and discouraging.

If you watch **momentum + durability + weekday patterns**, December becomes useful:

- it shows which companies are gearing up,
- which ones are cleaning up,
- and where speed vs networking actually matters.

That’s the mindset I’m taking into January.
